# Memory Game Project

Web app that recreates the classic memory game, with the following features:
1. Timer;
2. Move counter;
3. Star rating that depends on the number of moves; and
4. Game restart button.

This project is done under the [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001) of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/). Starter code available [here](https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game).

## Instructions

Clone repository to your computer and open index.html.

Then jump right in and put your memory skills to the test by clicking on the cards and finding their match! Get the full 3 stars (and earn the respect of your peers) by matching all cards in less than 13 moves!

## Dependencies

The web app utilizes the [Font Awesome toolkit](http://fontawesome.io/) as card icons -- [min css file here](https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.6.1/css/font-awesome.min.css)
